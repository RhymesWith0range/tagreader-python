# ODBC Drivers

To be able to connect to OSISoft PI or AspenTech InfoPlus.21 servers using ODBC, you need to obtain and install
proprietary ODBC drivers. This is not required if you prefer to connect using REST APIs.

If you work in Equinor, then you can find further information and links to download the drivers on our
[wiki](https://wiki.equinor.com/wiki/index.php/tagreader-python).

If you do not work in Equinor: ODBC queries may already work for you, although it is typically not sufficient to
install the desktop applications from AspenTech or OSIsoft, since these normally don't come packaged with 64-bit
ODBC drivers. If tagreader complains about missing drivers, check with your employer/organisation whether the ODBC
drivers are available for you. If not, you may be able to obtain them directly from the vendors.
